EventHorizon, my 3rd place winning entry to the CodeCup 2018: http://archive.codecup.nl/2018/32/competition_qcomp_e219.html

The current state of the repository reflects some improvements I made after the competition, with which EventHorizon outperforms the 1st place winning entry in my testing. The exact source file submitted to the competition can be found in src/assembled/EventHorizon4_2_5.cpp.
